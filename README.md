# UI Methods
Sometimes, is easier to apply best practices if we have a method to do so. This document will try to consolidate a set of development methods to create web applications with many of the best practices recommended by the community.

## Why?
The [Merrian-Webster dictionary](http://beta.merriam-webster.com/dictionary/method) defines a method as *"a way, technique, or process of or for doing something"*. There are many activities that can be performed with a more predictable quality if we follow a method. Is easier to understand the various metrics yielded by a profiler if we have a method or model to do so, than if we try to navigate across all the information we get. 
The following sections will provide links and a little bit of information for each of the methods I know for frontend development.

## Accessibility

### HIKE
*What is HIKE?*

HIKE is an acronym to help you remember some basic principles of web accessibility:

**H** stands for headings and semantic markup.

**I** stands for images and labels.

**K** stands for keyboard navigation.

**E** asks for you to ACT with a little extra love for custom components and more.
